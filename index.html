            <h2 class="title">Red Chilli</h2>
            <p>India is the largest chilli producer in the world. Hence, Dried Red Chilli Whole Stemless is very commonly used in the tropical country.Chillies are probably one of the most commonly recognised vegetable/spice in the world. They are said to have originated in Southern America, but are now grown and eaten worldwide, gaining huge popularity in UK in the last 50 years. Western chefs often ask you to remove seeds when using fresh chilli. To my mind, seeds and the membranes are the best part of a chilli that give it its heat and flavour. Why eat chilli, if you can't stand the heat? In India, chillies are rarely known or sold by their proper names, people guess their heat by their size, look and feel. Generally speaking, smaller, thinner and firmer (more tightly packed with seeds) a chilli is, hotter it is. The large, hollow, milder ones are often used for making various ‘stuffed’ chilli dishes like pickles, pakoras and bhajies.

          <h3 class="section-title">Red Chilli</h3>
          <p class="section-description"></p>
        </div>
       <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class="row">Chilli is one of the most valuable crops in India.
          The crop is grown largely for its fruits all over
          India. It is used in India as a principal ingredient of various curries, and chutneys. It is also used for vegetables, spices, condiments, sauces, and pickles. Dry Chillies are used for curry powder.
          The red color in chili is due to "Capsanthin".
          Pungency in Chillies is due to the active constituent "Capsaicin", an alkaloid is extracted from Chillies and is used to the medicine.Dried red pepper may be used whole or powdered. India is the largest producer of red chillies. As the name suggests it is red in color and can be consumed as it is or can be broken down and made into a powder. It is really spicy and the intense heat is concentrated in the seeds.</div>
        <br>
        <h1>Soil Selection</h1>
        <div class="pic"><img src="assets/img/soil.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p>Chilli can be grown in a range of soils, but black soils which retain moisture for long periods are suitable for rainfed crop whereas well-drained soils, deltaic soils, and sandy loams are good under irrigated condition. However, in hills of Uttarakhand, Chilli is grown in a wide range of soils ranging from sandy to clay loam mixed with gravel and coarse sand.</p>
       <h1>Climate Requirement </h1>
       <p>The chili is a plant of a tropical and subtropical region -It grows well in warm and humid climate and a temperature of 20-25°C. Low moisture in the soil during blossom development and fruit formation causes the bud, deblossom and fruit drops. Excessive rainfall is detrimental to the crops because it brings about defoliation and rotting of the plant.
        As a rained crop, it is grown in areas receiving annual precipitation of 25-30 inches.</p>
        <h1>Irrigation Process</h1>
        <div class="pic"><img src="assets/img/irrigation.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300"></div>
        <p>Chilli cannot withstand heavy moisture. Hence irrigation should be given only when necessary.
          Frequent and heavy irrigation induces lanky vegetative growth and causes flower shedding.
          Plant growth, branching, and dry matter accumulation are adversely affected by excess irrigation. The number of irrigation and interval between irrigation depends on soil and climatic conditions. If the plants show drooping of leaves at 4 p.m., it is an indication that irrigation is needed. Flowering and fruit development in Chilli are the most critical stages of water requirement. Normally Chilli is grown under rain-fed condition. However, under the irrigated condition, care should be taken to avoid using water contaminated with fertilizers, pesticides, and fungicides. Irrigation should be done judiciously. Stagnation of water should not be allowed in nursery beds and fields.</p>

          <p class="section-description"></p>
        </div>
       <h1>Types of Diseases</h1>
        <div class="row">
          <ul>
            <li>Damping Off</li>
            <li>Leaf Spot</li>
            <li>Stem Rot</li>
            <li>Anthracnose</li>
            <li>Powdery Mildew</li>
            <li>Viral Infections</li>
            <li>Leaf Curl Virus Gemini Virus</li>
            <li>Mosaic virus</li>
            <li>Tomato Spotted wilt Virus</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Damping Off</h3>
        <div class="roman">
        <div class="gopi"><img src="assets/img/damping1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div class="gopi"><img src="assets/img/Damping off.png" alt=""></div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Damping off disease is caused by infections and as well as more moisture and less moisture. More moisture also supports fungal and other pathogen. Both pre-emergent and post emergent symptoms are common. Seedlings are killed at nursery and transplanted seedlings will also be killed. Infected tissues at the stem base and root base will be water soaked and soft later turning black killing the young plants.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Leaf Spot</h3>
        <div class="pic"><img src="assets/img/leafspot1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <br>
        <p>Fungal spots and bacterial spots are commonly found on chilli crop. Bacterial spots are characterized by the yellow ring around the ring but fungal spots are not. Septoria, cercospora leaf spots are more common.</p>
        
        <h3>Stem rot</h3>
        <div class="pic"><img src="assets/img/Stem_rot.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <br>
        <p>stem rot is characterized by water soaked light browner coloured patches on any part of the plant branches, they decay and all the leaves drop off with wilting symptoms.Phytophthora root and stem rot is a soil-borne fungal disease caused by Phytophthora sojae. This pathogen causes seed rots, pre- and post emergence damping off of seedlings and stem rot of plants at various growth stages. Disease development is favored by soil temperatures is above 60oF and high soil moisture.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Anthracnose</h3>
        <div class="pic"><img src="assets/img/anthracnose_disease_in_chilli_crop.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <br>
        <p>Anthracnose disease is more prominent in high moisture with cooler temperatures. The leaves will show the symptoms of black spot and on fruits the spots will be surrounded by the reddening. The disease will also show symptoms after at post-harvest stage.
          Anthracnose of capsicum and chillies can be a serious problem in tropical and subtropical regions. The damage caused by anthracnose is especially serious in many Asian counties including South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and Thailand, reducing marketable yields by 10-80%. In these countries, Colletotrichum acutatum is the most destructive of the several anthracnose pathogens present.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Powdery Mildew</h3>
        <div class="pic"><img src="assets/img/powdery1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <br>
        <p>Yellow blotches on upper surface of the leaves with Powdery-white fungal growth on the undersides of leaves are observed. The infected leaves curl upward. Usually the older leaves are infected first later move on to younger leaves. Infected leaves drop from the plant prematurely and many times the fruits are exposed to sunlight making the fruits sunscald.</p>
     <br>
    <h3>Viral Infections</h3>
    <div class="pic"><img src="assets/img/viral1.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <br>
    <p>Viral infections in chilli crops is another major diseases which cause much crop losses. Some of viral infection symptoms are mosaic, yellow mosaic, mosaic mottle, leaf curl, leaf roll, bushy stunt and leaf necrosis.Chilli leaf curl virus is transmitted by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) and is a serious threat to chili fields. Symptoms include the upward curling of leaves, plant stunting, and yield reductions. There are no treatments for viruses. Infected pepper plants cannot be cured; therefore, the focus should be on prevention.</p>
  <h4>Leaf Curl Virus Gemini Virus</h4>
  <div class="pic"><img src="assets/img/viral2.jpg" alt=""></div>
  <br>
      <p>Leaves are malformed and curled inwards to the side of mid rib with stunted plant growth. Flower parts under develop without forming to fruits.Symptoms of Chilli Leaf Curl Virus are characterized by upward curling of leaf margins, yellowing of veins and reduction of leaf size.

      </p> 
    <h3>Mosaic Virus</h3>
    <div class="pic"><img src="assets/img/viral3.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <br>
  <p>Irregular light green and dark patches with mosaic appearances are observed on the leaves with smaller size. Stunted growth with yellow chlorotic ring spots on the under developed fruits.

.    Symptoms are extremely variable depending on the variety/ hybrid and on weather conditions. Common symptoms are: initial chlorotic lesions, followed by light- and dark-green areas appearing as mosaic. At later stages, newly emerging leaves distort or transform into filiform or thin, elongated leaves. In severe cases, plants get stunted and produce less number of fruits. Fruits from infected plants are hard and brittle, full of seeds. Yellow streaks may also appear on fruits. The virus is an isometric particle of 28 nm size, has a genome of single-stranded multipartite RNA and belongs to the Cucumovirus group.</p>
<h3>Tomato Spot Wilt Virus</h3>
<div class="pic"><img src="assets/img/viral4.jpg" alt=""></div>
<br>
<p>Recently the Tomato Spotted Wilt virus [TOSPOW] is common viral infection in tomato and the disease has also shown symptoms in chilli and capsicum. The leaves turn yellow, elongates and cluster apical growth is observed with little or no fruit set. The crop grown in high temperature season, with high use of ammoniacal nitrogen as nitrogen nutrient sources.</p>

            <br>
            <li>Treat the seeds with Trichoderma asperellum @ 4 g / kg or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g /kg of seeds 24 hours before sowing.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid stagnation of water.</li>
            <li>Drench with copper oxychloride at 2.5 g/l @ 4 l/sq.m.</li>
            <li>Soil drenching with Copper oxychloride 0.25%.</li>
            <li>Avoid shade places for nursery establishment.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Leaf Spot</h3>
        <p>The treatments to control this leaf spot include foliar spray of products containing copper hydroxide, chlorothalonil or mancozeb. Treatment should start when the spots first appear and continue at 10-14 days intervals until 3-4 weeks before the last harvest. It is important to spray both sides of the leaves.</p>

       <li>Spray mancozeb @ 2 g/l or copper oxychloride @ 2.5 g/l .</li>
       <li> Seed treatment with 0.1% mercuric chloride solution for 2 to 5 minutes is effective.</li>
       <li> Seedlings may be sprayed with Bordeaux mixture 1. Per cent or copper oxychloride 0.25%.</li>
       <li> Field sanitation is important. Also seeds must be obtained from disease free plants.</li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <h3>Stem Rot</h3>

   <p>Use a wider row distance allowing good ventilation of the crops. Use wires or stakes to support the plants. Monitor the field for signs of the disease. Control weeds in and around the field.</p>

      <div class="pic"><img src="assets\img\anthracnose3.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
    <p>
      The chemical fungicides generally recommended for controlling anthracnose disease are based on copper compounds, dithiocarbamates, benzimidazole and triazole compounds (Waller, 1992). Newer chemicals like strobilurins based fungicides (e.g., azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin) have also been used for its management.To prevent this, mencozeb 2 grams should be dissolved @ per litre of water and sprayed 2-3 times at an interval of 15 days.
    </p>
  <h3>Powdery Mildew</h3>
  <li>Management of Powdery mildew</li>
  <br>
  <div class="pic"><img src="assets\img\powdery2.jpg" alt=""></div>
  <br>
<p>Spraying Wettable sulphur 3 g/lit or Carbendazim 1 g/lit. Totally 3 sprays are required at 15 days interval from the first appearance of symptom.Biological fungicides (such as Serenade) are commercially available beneficial microorganisms formulated into a product that, when sprayed on the plant, destroys fungal pathogens. The active ingredient in Serenade is a bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, that helps prevent the powdery mildew from infecting the plant. While this product functions to kill the powdery mildew organism and is nontoxic to people, pets, and beneficial insects, it has not proven to be as effective as the oils or sulfur in controlling this disease.</p>
<h3>
  Viral Infections
</h3>
<p>Supplementation of Manganese micronutrients through foliar sprays and soil application will help in managing the viral infections not only in chilli but also in vegetable crops. Integrated nutrient management practices followed effectively may reduce the chances of viral infections in chilli crop.</p>
<h3>Leaf Curl Virus Gemini Virus</h3>
<p>There are no known effective methods for preventing or reducing chilli leaf curl virus. Follow chemical control methods, such as imidacloprid or dinotefuran. Spray seedlings with imidacloprid or lambda-cyhalothrin before transplanting to control the vector.</p>
<h3>
  Mosaic Virus
</h3><p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove all infected plants and destroy them.
      </li>
      <li>Do NOT put them in the compost pile, as the virus may persist in infected plant matter.</li>
      <li>Monitor the rest of your plants closely, especially those that were located near infected plants.</li>
      <li>  Disinfect gardening tools after every use.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus</h3>

<p>
 <ul>
  <li>
    Avoid planting near crops infected with Tomato spotted wilt virus.

  </li>
  <li>Monitor for thrips and tomato spotted wilt symptoms.</li>
  <li>If thrips are present and symptoms are observed, manage thrips to minimize the spread of the virus within the field</li>
  <li>Consider removing infected plants at the seedling stage.</li>

              <h2>Different ways of preserving chillies</h2>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li> <h4>Dry your chillies </h4>
                  
                      <div class="column"><img src="assets/img/drying3.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="200"  >
                      <!-- <div class="column"><img src="assets/img/drying6.jpg" alt=""  ></div>  -->
                      </div>
                    <p>Drying is a great way to preserve your leftover chillies and there are several ways to do it. Scotch Bonnets, Habaneros and other fleshy varieties tend not to dry very well, unless you have a dedicated dehydrator. Drying is more suited to waxier chillies such as Birds Eye and Indian Peppers. Traditionally, chillies would be laid out in the sun to dry, giving warmth and ventilation, but this is not always possible in cooler climates. If you have neither a dehydrator nor a warm climate, the important thing to remember is to keep your chillies warm and dry. Around 25˚C is optimum, much higher and you risk a very brittle product, lower and you risk losing your chillies to mould.

                      First rinse the chillies in salty water to help to prevent mould. Then spread them out on some moisture-absorbent tissue in a warm place such as a greenhouse, warm windowsill or airing cupboard, turning regularly. Store in an airtight container whole or use a coffee grinder to produce chilli powder. Alternatively, string up your chillies in a Ristra, as pictured right. Either wrap cotton around the stems of numerous chillies to tie in a long bunch, or thread through the stems with a needle and cotton and hang up in a warm, dry place to dry. Ristras originate in Mexico and make beautiful decorations or gifts, fresh or dried.

                     <p>Chillies freeze reasonably well, retaining most of their flavour and heat. Freezing is the best way to preserve fleshier chillies like Scotch Bonnets and Habaneros. To freeze chillies whole, spread them out on a baking tray so they are not touching, freeze and pop into a sealed bag or container. This way they do not clump together. Frozen chillies, however, do not always keep their shape or texture well with freezing so you may prefer to process them first. Remove the stalks and the seeds if you like (seeds can go a bit brown on freezing but this will do no harm) and freeze in a sealed bag. You can them smash the bag with a rolling pin and use as required. Alternatively, pack the chopped chillies into an ice cube tray, then empty chilli cubes into a selaed bag to store to make easily measured portions. Keep the ice tray just for your chillies.</p></li>
                  <li > <h4>Pickling Your Peppers</h4> <p>Pickling works well for most types of chilli, keeping them crisp and hot as well as looking great in their jars. Take 1lb chillies, remove any damaged fruit, make a couple of tiny slits into each chilli and wash thoroughly in salt water. Mix with 15 peppercorns, 5 bay leaves and 3 tblsp salt and pack into pre-sterilised wide-mouthed jars, to 1cm below the rim. Heat 1 litre white wine, rice or cider vinegar with 6 tablespoons caster sugar until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is almost boiling. Pour into the jars with the chillies, cool a little and seal. Refrigerate and leave for at least 2 weeks.
                  </p></li>
